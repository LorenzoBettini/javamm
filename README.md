# Java--
Java-- is a simpler version of Java aiming to teach programming.

It is implemented with Xtext, https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext.

## Eclipse update site

Use this update site to install Java-- SDK feature.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/javamm/files/updates/releases

IMPORTANT: Java-- requires Xtext, if this is not already installed, all dependencies will be automatically installed form this update site, which is self-contained.

## Pre-configured Eclipse distributions with Java-- installed, for several architectures.

Alternatively, you can download a complete Eclipse distribution with Java-- installed; choose the one for your OS and architecture:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/javamm/files/products/

## Temporary Development Snapshots.

The snapshots are not necessarily stable, and they will be removed when the new version is released.
